# My Resume

### JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap 4, jspdf, JSON Resume, webpack

The aim is to create online resume based on JSON Resume standard (https://jsonresume.org/schema/) by preventing exposure of private personal information.

## Installation

Clone the directory

```
> git clone https://github.com/gordana16/my-resume.git
```

or

click [here](https://github.com/gordana16/my-resume/archive/master.zip) to download zip file. Once downloaded extract the zip file to your local computer.

Install dependencies by running

```
> cd my-resume
> npm install
```

## Build

Build to development environment, start application and development server:

```
> npm run dev
```

Build to production environment:

```
> npm run build
```

## Data configuration

Use environment variables to keep personal resume data secret. dotenv-webpack expects there to be a .env file to load in variables during the webpack build of bundle. .env is not comitted to Github, because for good reason it is in .gitignore.

The example of environment variables in .env:

```
NAME = Jane Doe
LABEL = SENIOR JAVA PROGRAMMER
EMAIL = jane@gmail.com
PHONE = (912) 555-4321

```

Each of environment variables is represented by "long" string which should be tokenized by using following delimiters: , ^ | Spaces before or after token are not allowed. If space is found, the token is disregarded.

## Deployment on Netlify

Environment variables should only be used by webpack build scripts to create content during build.When the repository is checked out by Netlify, the .env does not exist because it is in .gitignore.

Store resume data in the Netlify build environment variables and build the .env using a script prior to running the build command.

_script/create-env.js:_

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.writeFileSync(
  "./.env",
  `NAME=${process.env.NAME}\nLABEL=${process.env.LABEL}\nEMAIL=${process.env.EMAIL}\nPHONE=${process.env.PHONE}\nWEBSITE=${process.env.WEBSITE}\nSUMMARY=${process.env.SUMMARY}\nADDRESS=${process.env.ADDRESS}\nPOSTAL_CODE=${process.env.POSTAL_CODE}\nCITY=${process.env.CITY}\nCOUNTRY_CODE=${process.env.COUNTRY_CODE}\nREGION=${process.env.REGION}\nPROFILES=${process.env.PROFILES}\nWORK=${process.env.WORK}\nSKILLS=${process.env.SKILLS}\nEDUCATION=${process.env.EDUCATION}\nCERTIFICATES=${process.env.CERTIFICATES}\nLANGUAGES=${process.env.LANGUAGES}\n`
);
```

In order to deploy application on Netlify use:

npm run deploy

## Code Example

```javascript
export const mergeStringIntoObjArr = (longString, ...keys) => {
  const merged = {};
  return longString.split(/,(?!\s)/).map(str => {
    const values = str.split(/\^(?!\s)/);
    let localMerged = {};
    localMerged = keys.reduce(
      (obj, key, i) => ({ ...obj, [key]: values[i] }),
      {}
    );
    return { ...merged, ...localMerged };
  });
};

export const stringToArr = longString => {
  const result = longString.split(/\|(?!\s)/);
  return result;
};
```

The above functions are utility functions used for parsing environment variables.

```javascript
export const parseWorkExperience = () => {
  const exps = mergeStringIntoObjArr(
    resume.work,
    "company",
    "companyProfile",
    "position",
    "startDate",
    "endDate",
    "highlights"
  );
  return exps.map(exp => ({
    ...exp,
    highlights: stringToArr(exp.highlights)
  }));
};
```
